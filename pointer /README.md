C++ Pointer and Array Basics
AIM

To understand the basics of pointers, pointer arithmetic, and array manipulation in C++ through simple example programs.

APPLICATION USED

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

THEORY

Pointers in C++ store memory addresses of variables and allow indirect access and modification of values. Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, and their names decay to pointers to the first element. Pointer arithmetic allows traversing arrays by incrementing the pointer.

In the provided examples, you will see:

How pointers reference variables (int *aptr = &a;) and how dereferencing (*aptr) accesses or modifies the value.

How arrays relate to pointers, with arr being equivalent to &arr[0].

How pointer arithmetic (ptr++) moves the pointer to the next memory location of the type it points to.

PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS COVERED
Program 1: Pointer Basics

Declaring a pointer and assigning it the address of an integer variable.

Printing the pointer (address) and dereferenced value.

Modifying the value through the pointer.

Program 2: Array and Pointer Iteration

Initializing an integer array.

Accessing the first element using *arr.

Iterating over the array elements using a pointer and pointer arithmetic.

Program 3: Pointer Arithmetic on a Single Variable

Showing how incrementing a pointer (aptr++) changes the memory address it holds (moves to next integer address in memory).

ALGORITHM (Generalized Steps)

Declare variables and arrays.

Initialize pointers to point to variables or the first element of arrays.

Access or modify values via pointer dereferencing.

Use pointer arithmetic to traverse arrays or adjacent memory locations.

Print values or addresses as required.

CONCLUSION

These simple C++ programs help solidify understanding of pointers and arrays, key building blocks for low-level programming and efficient memory management. Mastering pointer declaration, dereferencing, and arithmetic lays a foundation for more advanced topics such as dynamic memory allocation and data structures.
